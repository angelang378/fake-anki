Work in progress.

Tested on iPhone 8, 8 Plus, 11, 11 Pro, 11 Max, and SE (2nd gen). Layouts on other devices may not be ideal (devices 8 Plus and up ideal).

I've been trying to learn Japanese this summer, and have heard that the Anki app is a pretty good language learning tool. Despite this, I've never ventured to use the app, but figured I'd make my own version of a language/vocab learning app anyways and see how it goes.
