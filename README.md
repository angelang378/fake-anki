Work in progress.

Tested on iPhone 8 Plus, so constraints and layout may be terrible on other devices (will work on this).

I've been trying to learn Japanese this summer, and have heard that the Anki app is a pretty good language learning tool. Despite this, I've never ventured to use the app, but figured I'd make my own version of a language/vocab learning app anyways and see how it goes.
