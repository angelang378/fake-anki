Work in progress.

Tested on iPhone 8 Plus, so constraints and layout may be terrible on other devices (will work on this).

I've never even used anki before, but have heard it being widely touted so I figured I'd make my own version of a language/vocab learning app and see how it stacks up.

Will add picture sources once all images chosen are finalized.
